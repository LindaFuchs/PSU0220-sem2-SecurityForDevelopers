2nd semester Software Development, Security for Development exam demonstration

Two concole applications:
One is a simple, but purposefully very flawed, login console application. 
The application allows logging in with user/666 and admin/42 and is designed to show exploitable security flaws.

The other is a brute force attack console application which takes input from a string list. 
It simulates entering every string in the list into the application in focus, and pressing enter to confirm.
